#### wvnderlab/disable-search/status-code *(Default: 404)*

You can set it to standard codes like 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), or redirect codes like 301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Found).

```php
// set the status code to 301 - Moved Permanently
add_filter( 'wvnderlab/disable-search/status-code', fn() => 301 );
// set the status code to 302 - Found
add_filter( 'wvnderlab/disable-search/status-code', fn() => 302 );
// set the status code to 307 - Temporary Redirect
add_filter( 'wvnderlab/disable-search/status-code', fn() => 307 );
